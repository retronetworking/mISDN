/* Description of the locking mechanism
 * 
 * The locking must grant serialisized and atomic
 * access to the ISDN hardware registers, if the lock
 * is aquired no other process or IRQ is alloed to
 * access ISDN hardware registers.
 *
 * In general here are 3 possible entry points:
 *    1. the ISDN interrupt routine
 *    2. ISDN timer routines in the hardware module
 *    3. messages that came from upper layers
 *
 * Since most work must be do in the interrupt routine
 * (to grant minimum IRQ latency) and only few things with
 * need direct HW access must be done for messages from upper
 * layers, we should allow other IRQs in our IRQ routines and
 * only block our own routines in this case. Since the common IRQ
 * routines allready mask the same IRQ, we only need to protect us
 * from timer and uper layers. The disadvantage is, that we need to
 * disable local IRQ for entry points 2. and 3., but since the routines
 * which need hardware access are well known and small, the impact
 * is very small.
 *
 * We have a two stage locking to make this working:
 * A spinlock which protect the state LOCK Flag (STATE_FLAG_BUSY) and
 * also protect us from local IRQs from the entry points 2 and 3.
 *
 * In the hardware IRQ we aquire the spinlock, set the STATE_FLAG_BUSY
 * LOCK Flag and then release the spinlock. It can never happen that
 * the STATE_FLAG_BUSY is already set in this case, see later.
 *
 * In the other cases (from timer or upper layers) we aquire the spinlock
 * test_and_set the STATE_FLAG_BUSY LOCK Flag, if it was allready set
 * (a ISDN IRQ is running on the other CPU) we schedule timeout or add a other
 * small timeout.
 * If it was not set, we have the lock and we don't release the spinlock until we have
 * done the harware work.
 *
 * To avoid any kind of deadlocking, it is important that we release the lock
 * before we call functions that deliver to upper layers.
 * To leave the impact of disabled local IRQ small, it is important to only protect
 * small areas where hardware is accessed.
 *
 * The following routines handle the lock in the entry point from upper layers and other
 * none IRQ cases (module init/exit stuff).
 *
 * They never called directly, but via the wrappers assigned to the instance
 * inst.lock / inst.unlock pointers.
 *
 * Here are two defines which can be used for DEBUGING and PROFILING
 * SPIN_DEBUG and LOCK_STATISTIC
 *
